Some of the key takeaways from my reading of the Google SRE book. These points stood out to me because they were things seemed not obious and piqued my interest.

- Beware of mean statistics, percentiles can reveal more information
    - This is because the distributions of response times often have long tails.
- Dashboards are pretty, but no one should ever have to watch them.
- Responses to alerts should require intelligence
- The benefits of automation are much more than time saving, infact this is one of the least important benefits
    - Consistency and enabling anyone to do the task (without expertise) are some of the benefits
- Whitebox monitoring is more valuable than blackbox monitoring as it allows you to address problems benfore they become catastrophes
    - End-to-end tests are an example of blackbox monitoring
    - 95th percentile response time is an example of whitebox monioring
- Turnup processes must be owned by the service owner
- Automation workflow should be idempotent when possible
